          {`I am not born to drift like leaves in air,
Nor beast of hunger, chasing what is near;
Within my heart, a quiet flame declaresâ€”
The soul was made for knowing, not for fear.

Aristotle whispered through the years of dust,
That virtue blooms between the wild extremes;
Not bound by impulse, nor by hollow trust,
But shaped through will, and strengthened by my dreams.

To live is more than breathing, more than days;
It is to seek the why beneath the sky,
To turn each wound into a wiser gaze,
And let my striving teach my spirit to fly.

So measure me not by wealth, or fleeting fame,
But by the good my spirit dares to claim.`}
